<h4>Abstract:</h4>
We consider the problem of designing an automatic grader for a laboratory in the
area of cyber-physical systems. The goal of this laboratory is to program a
robot for specified navigation tasks. Given a candidate student solution
(control program for the robot), our grader first checks whether the robot
performs the task correctly under a representative set of environment
conditions. If it does not, the grader automatically generates feedback hinting
at possible errors in the program. The auto-grader is based on a notion of
constrained parameterized tests based on Signal Temporal Logic (STL) that
capture symptoms pointing to success or causes of failure in traces obtained
from a realistic simulator. We define and solve the problem of synthesizing
constraints on a parameterized test such that it is consistent with a set of
reference solutions with and without the desired symptom. The usefulness of our
grader is demonstrated using a large data set obtained from an actual on-campus
laboratory course.<br><br>
